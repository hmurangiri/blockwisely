            <h1>What is Hashing?</h1>
            <p>Have you ever played a game of scavenger hunt where you have to find items that have been hidden around your house or neighborhood? Let's say your friend gives you a list of items you need to find, but instead of listing them out, they give you clues about each item. The clues help you figure out what each item is, and then you can go find it.</p>
            <p>Hashing is kind of like a scavenger hunt, but for computers. When you want to store some information, like a password or a piece of text, you can "hash" it. Hashing is like creating a clue for the information that you want to store. The computer takes the information and does some fancy math to turn it into a completely different set of letters and numbers. This new set of letters and numbers is called a "hash."</p>
            <p>Just like with a scavenger hunt, if you want to find the original information again, you have to use the clue (or the hash) to figure out what the original information was. When you want to check if a password is correct, for example, the computer can hash the password you enter and compare it to the hashed password that's stored in the database. If the two hashes match, that means you entered the correct password.</p>
            <p>Hashing is an important tool in computer security because it allows sensitive information to be stored in a way that's difficult for hackers to read. Even if a hacker gains access to a database of hashed passwords, they won't be able to read the original passwords because they're just a jumble of letters and numbers.</p>
