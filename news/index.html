                                                Bitcoin Pizza Day May 22nd: <br>
                                                Bitcoin Pizza Day is just around the corner, celebrated on May 22 every
                                                year, to mark the anniversary of the first documented purchase of goods
                                                using Bitcoin. On this day in 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz
                                                famously bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, which is now worth millions
                                                of dollars. Bitcoin Pizza Day has since become a symbolic event that
                                                represents the growth of the cryptocurrency industry and its increasing
                                                mainstream adoption.
